Positive emotional state —> Good for creative thoughts. We have a wide view and let in many different thoughts. 

Slightly negative uncomfortable emotional state —> Activates the conscious part of our thinking. Therefore it is better for getting things done.

Too negative emotional state —> We get a tunnel vision and cannot see clearly enough anymore.
