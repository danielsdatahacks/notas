# Innovate vs. Reuse
#Books/Don’t_make_me_think #Design

If you’re not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure that what you’re replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there’s no learning curve—so it’s as good as the convention, or (b) adds so much value that it’s worth a small learning curve. 

My recommendation: Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but take advantage of conventions when you don’t.
