# Vitamins vs. Painkillers
#Books/Hooked #Design

Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets.
Vitamins, by contrast, do not necessarily solve an obvious pain point. Instead they appeal to users’ emotional rather than functional needs.
My answer to the vitamin versus painkiller question: Habit-forming technologies are both. These services seem at first to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.
Example: Facebook was vitamin first. Nice to be communicating to people. Then it become painkiller: Habit was formed. Updating the status checking the status of friends. If you do not do this you feel a discomfort (pain). —> Facebook become painkiller.
