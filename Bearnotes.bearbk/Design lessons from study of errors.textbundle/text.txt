# Design lessons from study of errors
#Books/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things #Design

There are two types of errors. Mistake (user has not sufficient knowledge about the system) and slips (user accidentally presses the wrong key). A good system is designed in a way that mistakes or slips do not result in serious consequences.

Several design lessons can be drawn from the study of errors, one for preventing errors before they occur and one for detecting and correcting them when they do occur.

* Add constraints to prevent errors
* Undo option
* Confirmation and error messages
